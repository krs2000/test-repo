  About
<div>
Offbeat motion is a video production studio founded by Rafał Lipiński.

I am filmmaker based in the Netherlands, work worldwide.

I specialize in commercials, music videos, promotional films, corporate films and event coverage. I take care of it all  - starting from script through arranging a set, ligthing, shooting, editing and color grading. For bigger projects I organize and cooperate with film crew. 

I don't treat making films as a work, cinematography is my passion, most of my time a spend on constant developing skills. I always follow modern standards. Every new project I treat as a challange.  My main principle is the originality of each video.
Better go and watch my work, you will see that every project is different and uniqe.
